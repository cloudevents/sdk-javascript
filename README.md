The CloudEvents SDK for JavaScript.

This module will help you to:

* Represent CloudEvents in memory
* Use [Event Formats](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#event-format) to serialize/deserialize CloudEvents
* Use [Protocol Bindings](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#protocol-binding) to send/receive CloudEvents

_Note:_ Supported
[CloudEvents specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec): 0.3, 1.0

### A Note on Versioning

The CloudEvents protocol version is distinct from this module's version number.
For example, this module may be versioned as v2.0.0 but support the v0.3 and v1.0
versions of the CloudEvent specification.

## Usage

**See the full working example: [here](./examples/express-ex).**

### Installation

The CloudEvents SDK requires a current LTS version of Node.js. At the moment
those are Node.js 10.x and Node.js 12.x. To install in your Node.js project:

```console
npm install --save cloudevents-sdk
```

### Receiving and Emitting Events

#### Receiving Events

You can choose almost any popular web framework for port binding. Use an
`HTTPReceiver` to process the incoming HTTP request. The receiver accepts
binary and structured events in either the 1.0 or 0.3 protocol formats.

```js
const {
  CloudEvent,
  HTTPReceiever
} = require("cloudevents-sdk");

// Create a receiver to accept events over HTTP
const receiver = new HTTPReceiver();

// body and headers come from an incoming HTTP request, e.g. express.js
const receivedEvent = receiver.accept(req.body, req.headers);
console.log(receivedEvent.format());
```

#### Emitting Events

To emit events, you'll need to decide whether the event should be sent in
binary or structured format, and determine what version of the CloudEvents
specification you want to send the event as.

By default, the `HTTPEmitter` will emit events over HTTP POST using the
1.0 specification, in binary mode. You can emit 0.3 events by providing
the specication version in the constructor to `HTTPEmitter`. To send
structured events, add that string as a parameter to `emitter.sent()`.

```js
const { CloudEvent, HTTPEmitter } = require("cloudevents-sdk");

// With only an endpoint URL, this creates a v1 emitter
const v1Emitter = new HTTPEmitter({
  url: "https://cloudevents.io/example"
});
const event = new CloudEvent()
  .type(type)
  .source(source)
  .time(new Date())
  .data(data)

// By default, the emitter will send binary events
v1Emitter.send(event).then((response) => {
    // handle the response
  }).catch(console.error);

// To send a structured event, just add that as an option
v1Emitter.send(event, { mode: "structured" })
  .then((response) => {
    // handle the response
  }).catch(console.error);

// To send an event to an alternate URL, add that as an option
v1Emitter.send(event, { url: "https://alternate.com/api" })
  .then((response) => {
    // handle the response
  }).catch(console.error);

// Sending a v0.3 event works the same, just let the emitter know when
// you create it that you are working with the 0.3 spec
const v03Emitter = new HTTPEmitter({
  url: "https://cloudevents.io/example",
  version: "0.3"
});

// Again, the default is to send binary events
// To send a structured event or to an alternate URL, provide those
// as parameters in a options object as above
v3Emitter.send(event)
  .then((response) => {
    // handle the response
  }).catch(console.error);

```

## Community

- There are bi-weekly calls immediately following the [Serverless/CloudEvents
  call](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec#meeting-time) at
  9am PT (US Pacific). Which means they will typically start at 10am PT, but
  if the other call ends early then the SDK call will start early as well.
  See the [CloudEvents meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OVF68rpuPK5shIHILK9JOqlZBbfe91RNzQ7u_P7YCDE/edit#)
  to determine which week will have the call.
